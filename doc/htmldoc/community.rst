Mailing list
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The NEST users mailing list is intended to be a forum for questions on the usage
of NEST, the exchange of code and general discussions about NEST.  The philosophy
is that all users profit by sharing their experience. All NEST core developers
are subscribed to this list and will participate in the discussions as far as
time allows.

By subscribing to the mailing list you will also get notified of all NEST related events!

Before submitting a question, please take a look at our :ref:`guidelines for the NEST mailing list <mail_guidelines>`.


Submit an issue or pull request on Github
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can :ref:`issues` on Github or contribute to the code or documentation. See our :ref:`contribute` page for
details.

Open video conference
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Every two weeks, we have an open video conference to discuss current issues and developments in NEST.
We welcome users with questions regarding their implementations or issues they want help solving to join.
This is an opportunity to have discussions in real time with developers.

Information for dates and how to join can be found on `our GitHub wiki <https://github.com/nest/nest-simulator/wiki/Open-NEST-Developer-Video-Conference>`_
